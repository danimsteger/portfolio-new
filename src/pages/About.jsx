        Hi! My name is Danielle Steger, and I am an aspiring software developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am originally from Irmo, South Carolina, and currently reside in
        Cayce, South Carolina. In 2019, I graduated from the University of South
        Carolinas Honors College with a Bachelor of Science in Middle Level
        Education, concentrating in mathematics and social studies. I taught
        seventh-grade math for three years in Columbia, South Carolina. During
        my time teaching, I also worked as the Camp Director at Gravatt Camp and
        Conference Center, an Episcopal center in Aiken, South Carolina. In
        2021, I earned a Master of Arts in Organizational Leadership from
        Columbia College.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2024, I began my journey into the tech field by joining the
        University of North Carolina - Charlotte Coding Boot Camp for full-stack
        web development. I am eager to continue learning new languages and
        skills to prepare me for my new career.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy tutoring mathematics at all levels, spending
        time with my dog, Mojo. I am an avid Survivor viewer, love reading, and
        enjoy thrifting for items for my home. I also cherish spending time with
        my family and traveling.
